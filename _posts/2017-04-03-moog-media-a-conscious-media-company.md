Outside of doing my normal computer programming thing, I actually run a film & media company with my twin sister Narina. It wasn't until I began planning the build of my company website that I realized the importance of lessons in constraint that the web development services industry is able to teach. It is important to take a large wisp of an idea and boil it down to its bare minimum functional and presentable state prior to development. I always like to use Dropbox as an example of this; at DropBox's inception, it was no more than a "put file in cloud, send file, download file" kind of application. Slowly, over the years its functionality grew to what it is now. If it had launched attempting to be all that it is now, it is likely that it would have run out of steam fairly quickly, or launched with a variety of half-baked features.

This is why I decided to go way back to basics and actually build out the MVP of the MOOG Media website using straight-up HTML & CSS (with gulp for my sanity). Virtually the entire website consists of an `index.html`, a `scripts.js`, and a `styles.css` file (and an assets folder). Theres actually something nostalgic about the simplicity of it. Of course this isn't sustainable in the long run, and I'm already working on converting it to a Jekyll site; but the point of this lesson is that it is important to evaluate the smallest use-case prior to development and use that to build an MVP. This keeps scope small and allows it to progress at a sane pace until after a prolonged period of time you can take a step back and see how complex the project has gotten and how nerve-racking it would have been to try to build it all right away.

In case you were curious:

MOOG Media is a collective of artists that love to create, to shake things up, to make something real out of abstract ideas, and to bring brainchildren safely into this chaotic world, whatever the means. Whether it’s to build an online home for your product, to capture your brand through moving image, or connect you with the right people in all corners of the world, we are passionate about the power of art, smart design and meaningful relationships to enrich our physical and virtual spaces. If you have a simple, or radical, idea, we want to hear it. Because that’s where the magic begins.
