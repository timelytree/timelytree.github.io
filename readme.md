### TimelyTree

That time when you walked 12 blocks only to realize you have no recollection of them. Something’s been chewing at your mind. People are giving you weird glances. Halfway through the 13th block, your eye catches a lonesome oak tree amongst a sea of concrete; you can’t help but stop and stare at it. This hunk of a tree, just standing there; timeless and serene. You feel like someone just hit the ‘flush’ button on your brain. A moment of peace from a timely tree.
